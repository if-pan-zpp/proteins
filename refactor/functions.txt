SIMULATION:
	prepare			Simple	A function called before each step. Zeroes a lot of variables
					and recalculates many auxilary variables, like 'v' or 'vxv'.
	eval_chirality		Simple	Computes the energy and forces arising from chirality potential.
	predct 			VSimple Predictor step from the predictor-corrector method.
	corr			VSimple Corrector step from the predictor-corrector method.

MATH:
	dihedral		Simple	Calculates dihedral angle (for a given set of 4 vectors).
	bondangle		VSimple Calculates the bond angle (for a given set of 4 vectors).
	countpid 		Simple  Computes phi (angle used in PID) for a given pair of residues.
					Used only in 'print_map' -> 'compute_details'.
	norma			VSimple Takes a 3x3 matrix and normalizes its columns. Used only in kabsch.
	ran2 			Simple	Random number generator.
	
			

INPUT:  Every function here is called at most once and before the main loop starts.

	compute_native_angles	VSimple Computes dihedral and bond angles for native conformation.
	gopotential 		Simple 	If 'lpdb' is true, it calculates the sigmas of L-J potential
					for all contacts (the meaning of sigmas - p. 9 in the paper).
	model_chirality 	VSimple	Calculates the chiralities for the native structure.
	amino_acid_mass		VSimple Computes masses of residues relative to the mass
					of the entire protein. 		

	compute_contact_map 	Medium 	Computes native contacts from a PDB file based on the positions
					of individual atoms in the amino-acids.
	compute_cmap 		Simple  Simpler alternative to 'compute_contact_map'. It defines a contact
					between residues by the cut-off on the distance between C-alpha atoms.
	assign_VdW_radius 	Medium 	Part of 'compute_contact_map'. It assigns the Van der Waals radius
					to all atoms in the amino-acids in the chains. Also performs some
					checks.
	load_allatom		Simple	Part of 'compute_contact_map'. Given the PDB file, it reads
					the native positions of atoms in the protein.
	load_protein 		Hard 	Loads the native conformation and SS bonds from the PDB file. 
					Big part of it runs only when 'lunwrap' is true
					(unwrapping coordinates arising from periodic boundary conditions).
	load_cmap		VSimple	Loads native contacts directly from a .map file (also dihedral
					and bond angles).
	displace 		Simple  Displaces one specified pair of chains away from each other
					by a given distance.
	

STATISTICS:
	gyration		VSimple	Computes radius of gyration of the protein, which is the
					standard deviation of distances from residues to the center of mass.
	cgyration		Medium	Computes various statistics - the radii of gyration for all chains,
					also W (asphericity parameter), whatever that is.
	

OUTPUT:
	print_restart		VSimple	Prints the restart file.
	print_conf_xyz		VSimple Prints the conformation in the XYZ format.
	print_cmap		VSimple	If 'lwritego' is true, no simulations are performed and this
					function prints the contact map.

WALLS:
	connect_to_wal_one_by_o	???	???
	connect_to_wal		???	???
	make_fcc		Simple	Creates a 2-layer, triangular lattice of beads that form a wall.

OTHER:
	angeval			Medium	Maybe the older version of evalangles.
	build_titin 		Simple 	Used for building titin - a very large protein composed
					of many protein domains.
	interdomain 		Simple	Next step for building titin, disables contacts between
					different domains of titin.
