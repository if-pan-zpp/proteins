cg_org.f is the original cg.f with a very small number of lines changed, so that
the features that are not important for the prototype are dropped.

cg_reduced.f is the cg.f with a lot of code cut out, so that only features
important for the prototype remain.

Both of the programs give the same results for the first example.
