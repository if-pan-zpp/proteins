This test should check if the prototype works with all potentials enabled 
(all implemented by now).

./script.sh copies the original cg.f file and applies a small patch 
that disables potentials that are not implemented yet 
and adds code that writes initial conditions to 'test_input.txt'
and another piece of code that writes final conformation to 'test_output.txt'.

Before running ./script.sh, one needs to copy the pt executable to this folder.

It seems that passing the test means getting maximum difference in position
of order 10^-6.
